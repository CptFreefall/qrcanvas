In late 2021 I released a video where I rendered Bad Apple!!'s music video on Project Nayuki's QR code generator.
For some reason, someone wanted to get their hands on this code.
So long as they're not doing it to impersonate me, or take credit for the four days spent working on it, then go right ahead.

Just be warned that the code, well, isn't good.
